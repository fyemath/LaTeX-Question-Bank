# LaTeX Question Bank for College Algebra

This question bank consists of questions in college algebra which are created using \LaTeX. Most questions are created using random variables which rely on the `pgfmath` package. To be more precise, the function `\pgfmathsetmacro{}{random(m,n)}` was frequently used to generate a number between `m` and `n`.
