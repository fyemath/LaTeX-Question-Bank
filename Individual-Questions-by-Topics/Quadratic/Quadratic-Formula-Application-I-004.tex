The hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle is \kk cm longer than either of its legs. Note that an isosceles right triangle is a right triangle whose legs are the same length. Find the exact length of its legs and its hypotenuse.


\begin{solution}
 Suppose the length of a leg is $x$ meters. Then the length of the hypotenuse is $x+\kk$. By Pythagorean identity: $\text{hypotenuse}^2=\text{Leg}^2+\text{Leg}^2$, we have the following equation
\[x^2+x^2=(x+\kk)^2.\] 
Simplify the equation, we get
\[x^2- \bb x \negksq=0.\]
By the quadratic formula, we get  
\[x=\dfrac{-(-\bb) +\sqrt{(-\bb)^2-4\cdot(\negksq)}}{2}=\kk+\invisibleoneincoef{\kk}\sqrt{2}.\]
So the leg is $\kk+\invisibleoneincoef{\kk}\sqrt{2}$ cm and the hypotenuse is $\bb+\invisibleoneincoef{\kk}\sqrt{2}$ cm.
