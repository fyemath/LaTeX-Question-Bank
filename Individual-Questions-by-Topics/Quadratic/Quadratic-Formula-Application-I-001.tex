A rectangle whose length is $3$ meters longer than its width has an area $5$ square meters. What is the dimension of the rectangle? Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a meter.


\begin{solution}
 Suppose the width is $x$ meters. Then the length is $x+3$. By the rectangular area formula: $Area=Width~\times~Length$, we have the following equation
\[x(x+3)=5.\] 
Simplify the equation, we get
\[x^2+3x-5=0.\]
By the quadratic formula, we get  
\[x=\dfrac{-3+\sqrt{29}}{2}\]
So the width is approximately $1.2$ meters and the length is approximately $4.2$ meters.
\end{solution}
