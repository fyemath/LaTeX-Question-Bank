A rectangle whose length is $\kk$ meters less than twice its width has an area $\area$ square meters. What is the length of the diagonal? Round your answer to the nearest thousandth of a meter.


\begin{solution}
 Suppose the width is $x$ meters. Then the length is $2x-\kk$ meters. By the rectangular area formula: $\textup{Area}=\textup{Width}~\times~\textup{Length}$, we have the following equation
\[x(2x-\kk)=\area.\] 
Simplify the equation, we get
\[2x^2-\kk x-\area=0.\]
By the quadratic formula, we get  
\[x=\dfrac{-\kk+\sqrt{(-\kk)^2-4\cdot 2\cdot (-\area)}}{2\cdot 2}=\dfrac{-\kk+\sqrt{\discr}}{4}.\]
So the width is approximately $\frac{-\kk+\sqrt{\discr}}{4}$ meters and the length is $\frac{\sqrt{\discr}-\kkk}{2}$ meters. 
The diagonal is 
\[
\sqrt{\left(\dfrac{-\kk+\sqrt{\discr}}{4} \right)^2+ \left( \dfrac{\sqrt{\discr}-\kkk}{2}\right)^2} \approx \pgfmathprintnumber[fixed, precision=3]{\ans}
\]
meters.
