The hypotenuse of a \textbf{right triangle} is $\aa$ feet long. One leg is $2$ feet longer than the other. Find the length of each leg to the nearest tenth of a foot.


\begin{solution}
 Suppose the shorter leg is $x$ feet. Then the longer leg is is $x+2$. By Pythagorean Theorem, we have the following equation
\[x^2+(x+2)^2=\aa^2.\] 
Simplify the equation, we get
\[x^2+2x \cc=0.\]
By the quadratic formula, we get  
\[x=-1+\sqrt{\rr}.\]
So the legs are approximately $\pgfmathprintnumber[fixed, precision=1]{\shrt}$ feet and $\pgfmathprintnumber[fixed, precision=1]{\lng}$ feet.
\end{solution}
