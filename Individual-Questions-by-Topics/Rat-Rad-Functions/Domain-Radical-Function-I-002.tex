\pgfmathtruncatemacro{\a}{random(1,7)}



Find the domain of the following rational function and write your answer in interval notation
\[
  f(x)=\sqrt{x^2+\a}
\]

\begin{solution}
The rational function is well-defined if $x^2+\b\geq 0$. Since the $x^2\geq 0$ for all real numbers. Then the domain of this function is the set of real numbers.  In interval notation, the domain is 
\[(-\infty, \infty).\]
\end{solution}
