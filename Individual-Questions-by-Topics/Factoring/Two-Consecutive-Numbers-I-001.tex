The production of two \textbf{consecutive even \textit{negative} } numbers is $\mn$. Find the two numbers.


\begin{solution}

Suppose the smaller number is $n$. The consecutive even number is $n+2$. We then have an equation
\[ n(n+2)=\mn \] 
Solve the equation to find $n$.
\[
\begin{split}
	n(n+2)&=\mn \\
	n^2+2n&=\mn\\
	n^2+2n-\mn&=0\\
	(n+\nn)(n-\mm)&=0\\
\end{split}
\]
Then $n=-\nn$ or $n=\mm$. Since the numbers are negative, we conclude the two numbers are $-\nn$ and $-\mm$.
\end{solution}
