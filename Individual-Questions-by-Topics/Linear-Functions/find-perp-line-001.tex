Find the slope-intercept form of the equation of the line perpendicular to the line $6y-3x=-2$ and passing through $(2, -5)$.

\begin{solution}
Solve for $y$ from $6y-3x=-2$, we get $y=\frac12x-\frac13$. The slope of the line $6y-2x=-2$ is $\frac12$. The slope of the perpendicular line is $\frac21(-1)=-2$. The slope-intercept for of the perpendicular line should be $y=-2x+b$. Since $(2, -5)$ is on the perpendicular line, we must have $-5=-2(2)+b$. Solve for $b$, we get $b=-1$. Therefore, the slope-intercept form of the perpendicular line is $y=-2x-1$.
