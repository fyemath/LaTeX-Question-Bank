Find an equation of the line passing through the following two points
\[(\a, \b)\text{\quad and\quad} (\x, \y).\]
Write the equation in the slope-intercept form if the slope is not undefined. 


\begin{solution}

The slope is 
\[
m=
\ifnum\y<0 
	\frac{\b-(\y)}{\a-\x} 
\else
	\frac{\b-\y}{\a-\x}
\fi
=\simplyfrac{\mnum}{\mden}.
\]

\ifnum\mnum=0
	Since the slope is $0$, the line is a horizontal line and the slope-intercept form equation is 
	\[y=\b.\]
\else
	\ifnum\mden=0
		Since the slope is undefined, the line is a vertical line and an equation is 
		\[x=\a.\]
	\else
		We can then write down the point-slope form equation of the line.
		\[
			\ifnum\y<0 
				y-(\y) 
			\else
				y-\y
			\fi
			=
			\ifdim\n pt=1 pt
				x-\x
			\else
				\ifdim\n pt=-1 pt
					-(x-\x)
				\else
					\rdfrac{\mnum}{\mden}(x-\x).
				\fi
			\fi	
		\]
		Solve for $y$ and simplify the equations, we will get the slope intercept form.
		\[
		\begin{split}
		\ifnum\y<0 
				y-(\y) 
			\else
				y-\y
		\fi
			&
		=\ifdim\n pt =1 pt 
				x-\x
			\else
				\ifdim\n pt =-1 pt
					-(x-\x)
				\else
					\rdfrac{\mnum}{\mden}(x-\x).
				\fi
			\fi	
		\\
		y   & 
		=\ifdim\n pt =1 pt

					\ifdim\n pt=-1 pt

		\ifnum\y>0

		\else
			(\y)
		\fi	
		\\
		y   &
		= \ifdim\n pt=1 pt

					\fi
				\fi	
		\ifnum\bsign=0 
			.

			\ifnum\bsign>0

			\else
				\rdfrac{\bnum}{\bden}.
			\fi
		\fi
