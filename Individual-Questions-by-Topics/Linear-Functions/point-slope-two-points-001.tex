\begin{question}
	Find the point-slope and slope-intercept forms of the equation of the line passing through $(3, 2)$ and $(6, 5)$.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
	The slope is $m=\dfrac{5-2}{6-3}=\dfrac33=1.$

	The point-slope form is 
	$y-2=x-3.$

	The slop-intercept form is 
	$y=x-1.$
\end{solution}
