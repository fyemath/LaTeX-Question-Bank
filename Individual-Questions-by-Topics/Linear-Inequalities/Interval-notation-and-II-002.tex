Write the solution set of the compound inequalities
\[x \leq -1\text{\quad\quad and\quad\quad} x >0 \]
in interval notation.

\begin{solution}
	Since there is no number less than -1 that is positive ($>0$), the solution set is empty. An empty set is denoted by $\emptyset$. On WeBwork, you may enter $\{\}$ for the empty set.
\end{solution}
